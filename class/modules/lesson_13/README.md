## 🏗️ What You'll Build

### **Blog Platform with High-Performance Caching**

Transform a slow database-dependent blog system into a lightning-fast cached application:

#### **Before: Slow Database Queries**
- User Profile: 150ms per request
- Blog Post: 250ms per request  
- Search Results: 500ms per request
- 100% database dependency

#### **After: Lightning-Fast Cache Responses**
- User Profile: 2ms (cached) 
- Blog Post: 2ms (cached)
- Search Results: 2ms (cached)
- 90%+ performance improvement

### **Key Features Implemented**
- ✅ **Redis Integration**: Production-ready Redis configuration
- ✅ **Smart Caching**: Strategic cache placement with optimal TTL
- ✅ **Cache Management**: Administrative endpoints for cache control
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Hit ratios and cache statistics
- ✅ **Resilience**: Graceful fallback when cache unavailable

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this lesson, you will:

- **Configure Redis** as a centralized cache store for Spring Boot
- **Implement cache annotations** for optimal performance without code complexity
- **Design cache strategies** with appropriate TTL policies for different data types
- **Monitor cache performance** with comprehensive metrics and health checks
- **Handle cache failures** gracefully with fallback mechanisms
- **Build production-grade caching** used in enterprise applications

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Spring Boot 3.5.4** - Application framework
- **Spring Cache** - Caching abstraction layer
- **Redis 7** - High-performance in-memory cache store
