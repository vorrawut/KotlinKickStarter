## 🏗️ What You'll Build

### **Background Processing System**

Transform a blocking application into a high-performance async system:

#### **Before: Blocking Operations**
- User Registration: 3+ seconds (blocks for email + audit)
- Email Sending: Synchronous operations blocking requests
- Manual Maintenance: No automated cleanup or monitoring
- Single-threaded Processing: Poor resource utilization

#### **After: Lightning-Fast Async Operations**
- User Registration: <100ms (instant response)
- Email Sending: Asynchronous with CompletableFuture tracking
- Automated Maintenance: Scheduled cleanup and monitoring
- Multi-threaded Processing: Optimized resource utilization

### **Key Features Implemented**
- ✅ **Async Email System**: Welcome emails, password resets, bulk notifications
- ✅ **Scheduled Cleanup**: Automated database maintenance and cache warming
- ✅ **Task Monitoring**: Real-time execution metrics and health checks
- ✅ **Thread Pool Management**: Optimized pools for different workloads
- ✅ **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics and monitoring
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery and circuit breaker patterns

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
