## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Option 1: Workshop Mode (Learning)**
```bash
cd class/workshop/lesson_15
./gradlew bootRun
```
Follow the [Workshop Guide](workshop_15.md) to implement file handling step-by-step.

### **Option 2: Complete Solution (Reference)**
```bash
cd class/answer/lesson_15  
./gradlew bootRun
```
Study the complete implementation with all features.

### **Test File Operations**
```bash
# Upload a file
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/files/upload \
  -F "file=@test-image.jpg" \
  -F "category=IMAGE" \
  -F "title=Test Upload" \
  -F "isPublic=true"

# Download the file
curl -O http://localhost:8080/api/files/download/1

# Stream large file with range
curl -H "Range: bytes=0-1023" http://localhost:8080/api/files/stream/1
```

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### **File Upload Performance**
- Small Files (<1MB): <200ms processing time
- Medium Files (1-10MB): <2s processing time
- Large Files (10-100MB): <30s processing time
- Validation Overhead: <50ms per file

### **Download Performance**
- Direct Download: ~100MB/s transfer rate
- Streaming with Ranges: Supports video/audio seeking
- Concurrent Downloads: 50+ simultaneous connections
- CDN Integration: Global distribution capabilities

### **Storage Efficiency**
- Local Storage: Direct filesystem access
- Cloud Storage: S3 integration with proper error handling
